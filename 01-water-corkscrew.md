## Story
As an environmental feature that wraps around a larger (stone) sculpt, I want a winding/corkscrew water feature in order to draw the player's attention to the sculpt it's wrapping. It should be completely solid (little visible flecks) and doesn't require any other styling.

## Notes
- wraps a cave that the player can enter
- bordered by small rocks / make use of a 'dugout' within the sculpture it's wrapping
- should end above the ground / near the cave entrance to allow for a waterfall to be painted in
